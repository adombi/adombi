Hi 👋 My name is Ákos Dombi
===========================

I'm a curious developer, who is always eager to explore new technologies.
--------------------------------------------------------------

Beginning of my career I've built robust web applications, and then transitioned to the dynamic world of Big Data. Currently, I specialize in developing high-throughput data pipelines using Kafka, Java, Kotlin, Spring Boot, Reactive programming, and Kubernetes. I'm passionate about leveraging Kubernetes and continue to enjoy building internal web tools to enhance team productivity. I thrive on exploring new technologies and applying them in practical pet projects. I recently delivered my first meetup talk and am excited to present at KCD Budapest 2025. Feel free to explore my repositories for examples of meetup resources, and I'm always open to discussing data pipelines and k8s.
